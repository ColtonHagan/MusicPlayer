Title: Online Music Library
Objective: The student will create a command line program that simulates an online music library. The program will allow users to create and manage playlists, search for songs, and play songs.
Instructions:
Create a new Java project in your preferred development environment.
Create a class called "Song" that has the following fields: song title, artist, album, and duration.
Create another class called "Playlist" that has the following fields:playlist name and a list of songs.
Create a class called "MusicLibrary" that contains the following methods:
public static void main(String[] args): This method should display a menu of options to the user (e.g., "1. Create playlist, 2. Add song, 3. Removesong, 4. Search song, 5. Play song, 6. Exit"), and repeatedly prompt the user to select an option until they choose to exit. Depending on the option selected, it should call the appropriate method to perform the desired action.
public static Playlist createPlaylist(String name): This method should take in a string representing the playlist name and create a new Playlist object with an empty list of songs.
public static void addSong(Playlist playlist, Song song): This method should take in a Playlist object and a Song object, and add the Song to the list of songs in the Playlist.
public static void removeSong(Playlist playlist, Song song): This method should take in a Playlist object and a Song object, and remove the Song from the list of songs in the Playlist.
public static List<Song> searchSong(String keyword): This method should take in a string representing a keyword and search the library for songs that match the keyword, returning a list of matching songs.
public static void playSong(Song song): This method should take in a Song object and simulate playing the song by printing out the song's details (title, artist, album, duration)
